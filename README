# Art Digitizer

### Digitize Grayscale Drawings
If you have a drawing that is in grayscale, run the following command to digitize it:
`python digitize-gray-scale.py <path-to-image> <output-path>`

It will produce an image containing only the drawing in grayscale, with the background being transparent or white depending on the file format.
